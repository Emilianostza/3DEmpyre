    %% Users & Auth
    User([User]) --> Auth{Auth Context}
    Auth -->|Role: Public| Public[Landing Pages]
    Auth -->|Role: Employee| EmpDash[Employee Portal]
    Auth -->|Role: Customer| CustDash[Customer Portal]

    %% Employee Context
    subgraph Employee_Portal ["Employee Workspace"]
        EmpDash --> ProjMgmt[Project Mgmt]
        EmpDash --> AssetMgmt[Asset Mgmt]
        EmpDash --> EditorLink[3D Editor]

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd managed-capture-3d-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Navigate to the app**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 🔐 Mock Authentication

The application uses a robust **mock authentication system** for MVP development. No backend is required.

### Demo Credentials

| Role              | Email               | Permissions                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Project Owner** | `client@bistro.com` | View Dashboard, Approve Assets  |
| **Team Member**   | `admin@company.com` | Full System Access, Edit Models |
| **Technician**    | `tech@company.com`  | Upload Assets, Basic Editing    |

_Note: Any password will work for these accounts._

## 🚀 Deployment (Production)

### Stage 1: Netlify + Supabase + Storage

Deploy to production using Netlify for hosting, Supabase for database & auth, and Supabase Storage for 3D assets.

**Quick Start**:

1. **Read the full guide**: [`docs/DEPLOYMENT_STAGE1.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT_STAGE1.md)

2. **TL;DR Deploy Steps**:

   ```bash
   # 1. Create Supabase project at https://app.supabase.com
   # 2. Apply database schema (SQL file in dashboard)
   # 3. Connect repository to Netlify at https://app.netlify.com
   # 4. Set env vars in Netlify:
   #    - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
   #    - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   # 5. Push to main branch → Auto-deploys
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: Stage 1 deployment ready"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check Netlify build: https://app.netlify.com → Deploys tab
   - Test deep route refresh: `/login` → should work
   - Sign in with real credentials
   - Upload a 3D model to test storage

**What's Included**:

- ✅ SPA fallback for client-side routing
- ✅ Netlify Functions for server-side logic
- ✅ Supabase Auth (email + password)
- ✅ Supabase Storage (3D models + thumbnails)
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Audit logging

**Status**: Production-ready for Stage 1. No real backend code needed.
